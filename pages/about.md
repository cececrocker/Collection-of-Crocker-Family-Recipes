## About the Collection

This site houses a collection of family recipes that date back through the last five generations of family members. Each recipe has been edited several times and the final result is written on a recipe card. The objects in this collection follow the favorite recipes that are comforting foods, baked goods or favorite beverages of my family. Some of them are alcoholic and all of them have been tripled in amount for family gatherings. The recipes listed here are those that would be for a more modest serving of people.

Each family recipe that I chose was off of my own memory and connection to the dish, whether they be a favorite of mine to cook when a bad day hits, or the memories associated with the dishes. Many of these recipes come from different generations, and each generation has edited the dish so that the cookbook it originally came from is mostly pencil or pen, replacing the original ingredients with substitutions that are far tastier.

In this collection, there is an incredible amount of baked goods, as those are the ones that I have the most memory of making with other members of my family when I was younger. The beverages I learned to make when I was older, as several of them are alcoholic, though I have memories of watching family members make the drinks and talking about the different ingredients order.

The physical cookbooks themselves are very worn through and damaged, so we have, as a family, been working to transfer the recipes over to recipe cards so that if anything were to happen to the books themselves, that history would be preserved, even if it weren't in original handwriting.
